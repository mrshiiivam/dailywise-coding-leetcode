# Daily C++ DSA and LeetCode Challenges

Welcome to my repository! This repo contains my daily practice solutions for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++ on LeetCode. The goal is to solve a variety of problems to enhance my skills in problem-solving and algorithm development.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **LeetCode_Problems**: Contains daily LeetCode challenges.
- **DSA_Topics**: Contains problems and solutions categorized by DSA topics such as arrays, linked lists, dynamic programming, trees, etc.
- Each folder contains C++ solution files and may include additional explanation files or comments within the code.

## Languages and Tools

- C++
- LeetCode Platform
- Standard Template Library (STL)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mrshiiivam/daily-cpp-dsa-leetcode.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the problem directory and compile the code:
    ```bash
    cd LeetCode_Problems/Two_Sum
    g++ solution.cpp -o solution
    ./solution
    ```

3. You can also use online platforms like LeetCode to directly test the solution by copying the code into the problem submission box.

## Problem List

| Problem Name               | Difficulty | Solution Link                     |
|----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Two Sum                    | Easy       | [Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/) |
| Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters | Medium    | [Solution](./LeetCode_Problems/Longest_Substring/solution.cpp) |

## Topics Covered

- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Trees & Graphs

## Future Plans

- Add more explanations and optimized solutions for complex problems.
- Focus on harder LeetCode problems and advanced DSA topics like graph algorithms, segment trees, and more.
